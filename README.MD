# ComfyUI Workflows by GizAI

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for ComfyUI workflows by [giz.ai](https://www.giz.ai/). This repository features a collection of optimized and easy-to-use workflows designed to enhance your AI video generation projects using the powerful ComfyUI tool.

## About

These workflows are powered by giz.ai, an all-in-one AI and productivity platform. The workflows in this repository are tailored to meet the needs of creators, developers, and researchers working with AI-powered video generation, image manipulation, and more.

## Featured Workflow: AnimateLCM-FaceID

The `AnimateLCM-FaceID.json` workflow is currently featured and available for free beta testing on our platform at [giz.ai/ai-face-video](https://www.giz.ai/ai-face-video/). This workflow integrates the power of the AnimateLCM model with FaceID to create dynamic, realistic face animations directly from text prompts and images. 

## Example Video

Below is an example video generated using the `AnimateLCM-FaceID.json` workflow. The prompt used is sourced from OpenAI's Sora:

> *"A stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated city signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots, and carries a black purse. She wears sunglasses and red lipstick. She walks confidently and casually. The street is damp and reflective, creating a mirror effect of the colorful lights. Many pedestrians walk about."*
Please note that the FaceID feature was not utilized in this particular example.
